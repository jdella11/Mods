# Mods

This repository will hold all mod(s) created by myself for Ark:Survival Evolved using the Ark Devkit (Unreal Engine 4) and 3ds Max (for modeling).  These mods are inteded to be personal projects rather than a service as a mod creator.  This is due to time constraints which leads to mainly the lack of updates/communication that I think is "required" of a mod creator.  However if the mod(s) don't become as time intesive as my first impressions then I absolutely would like to release them as public.

## Getting Started/Installing

Open the Ark Devkit (located in the Epic Games launcher) and navigate to 'Games/Mods/'.

Create new folder and name it 'MoreFood' (not necissary).
